# git-add-progress ⏳

**Real-time `git add .` progress tracker with ETA (Estimated Time Remaining) & Progress Bar**

🚀 **git-add-progress** is a simple yet powerful **Bash script** that helps track the progress of `git add .` in **real-time**, showing the percentage completed, estimated time remaining (**ETA**), and a **progress bar**. 

### 🏆 **Why Use This Script?**
When working with large Git repositories containing **thousands of files**, the standard `git add .` command does not show progress. This leads to uncertainty about:
- ⏳ **How long will it take to finish?**
- 📊 **How many files have been staged?**
- 🚀 **How can I track progress without slowing down Git?**

This script solves all of these problems by providing **live updates** while files are being staged.
